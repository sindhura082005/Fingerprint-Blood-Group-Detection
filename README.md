# 🧬 Fingerprint-Based Blood Group Detection using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **end-to-end deep learning system** to predict **human blood groups from fingerprint images** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
The system classifies fingerprints into **8 blood group categories**:  
**A+, A−, B+, B−, AB+, AB−, O+, O−**

The project demonstrates a **complete machine learning pipeline** including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a **Flask web application**.
